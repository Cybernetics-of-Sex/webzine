        <h1>Cybernetics of Sex Webzine</h1>
        This webzine is a shifting pool. A collection of ephemera, projects, questions, and reflections that were part of our Fall 2020 ITP class, “Cybernetics of Sex: Technology, Feminisms, & the Choreography of Control.” The Webzine Working Group’s process
        was one of gathering quotes, screenshots, and other signposts of what we shared with one another. For the design, it was important to us that process-based class ephemera hold the same weight as final projects in the network of lines and circles;
        the lines drawn between them evoking their cybernetic relations. For the data, the webzine uses our class’s collective Are.na channel as a CMS.

        <i>This webzine was collaboratively made by the Cybernetics of Sex Webzine Working Group (Emma Grimm, Viola He ,Melanie Hoff, Zeyao Li, Chaski No, Aileen Stanziola).
